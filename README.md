# Project title

Tic Tac Toe.

## Description

This is the tic tac toe game, it consists of aligning 3 same items vertically, horizontally or diagonally to win.

## To run the code.

I used DevC++ IDE to realize this small project, if you want to run the code by yourself, 
you can also use it or any other you want, you should build and run the file with .c extension. 

## The application.

I pushed the app with .exe extension (for windows) so you can directly try it.
